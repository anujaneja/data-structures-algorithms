		1. Sliding Window Algorithm:-
		Sliding Window Maximum/Minimum (Maximum/Minimum of all subarrays of size k). 
		Method 1: Using DQeue to maintain the max/min element as the first element of k size Dqeue. 
		Complexity: Time- O(n), space: O(k)
		Method 2: Using Quick Sort piovt element is the max of the batch. 
		Complexity:- O(nlogn)
		Method 3: Using Heap to get the max/min element for a window.
